Do a cute to-do list site. It is going to be devided in 2 parts. 
the 1st part stars with the title, where says "Meu canteiro". let me put a picture link after the tile, also do a "start botton" like a videogame botton.

When pressed start, it goes to the second part: The "garden" - to-do list. 
Put the day of the week and month, progression part and "write your task here" part, this part should be able to the person do add as many activities they want. 

after that, put the box of the activities the person wrote. End it with a botton the says "finish day" for the person to had their activies on the list complete.

Make it in pastel colors, add cute flowers.
